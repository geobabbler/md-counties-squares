# Maryland Counties as Squares

![example](example.png)

Maryland counties rendered as squares for use in data visualization.

This is a static GeoJSON file that renders the Maryland counties as squares. The location data is completely arbitrary and this data set is not intended for use in spatial analysis. I wanted this data set because I do a lot of data processing with GIS tools so I can join these features with any state-level analysis results I produce. The geometry itself would not be useful for actual mapping, but will be suitable in visualization tools such as D3 ([example](http://geobabbler.github.io/assets/demos/md-squares/)).
